## Standup Guidelines

✅ **Do:**
- Keep updates brief (1-2 minutes per person)
- Focus on collaboration, not status reporting
- Raise blockers immediately
- Stand up (keeps it short!)
- Start on time, end on time

❌ **Don't:**
- Have detailed technical discussions
- Problem-solve during standup
- Wait for someone to finish speaking to raise blockers
- Turn it into a status meeting
