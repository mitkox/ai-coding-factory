## Scrum Framework Components

### Roles

- **Product Owner**: Manages product backlog and priorities
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates Scrum events and removes impediments
- **Development Team**: Self-organizing team that delivers software increments

### Artifacts

- **Product Backlog**: Ordered list of all desired work
- **Sprint Backlog**: Subset of product backlog for current sprint
- **Increment**: Sum of all completed work during sprint

### Events

- **Sprint Planning**: Plan work for upcoming sprint
- **Daily Scrum**: 15-minute daily synchronization
- **Sprint Review**: Demonstrate completed work
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Inspect and adapt process

### Values

- **Commitment**: Committed to achieving sprint goals
- **Focus**: Focus on work and goals of the Scrum Team
- **Openness**: Work and challenges are made visible
- **Respect**: Respect different opinions and expertise
- **Courage**: Courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems

## Team Size Guidelines

### Optimal Team Size

- **Small Teams**: 3-5 members
  - High collaboration
  - Quick decisions
  - Easy coordination

- **Medium Teams**: 6-9 members
  - Good balance of collaboration and specialization
  - Scalable for most projects
  - **Recommended for most teams**

- **Large Teams**: 10+ members
  - May need subteams
  - Requires more coordination overhead
  - Consider splitting into multiple Scrum teams

### Team Composition

**Cross-Functional Teams** (Recommended):
- Frontend developers
- Backend developers
- Database specialists
- DevOps engineers
- Quality Assurance engineers
- Product/UX designers (optional)

**Skill-Based Teams** (Alternative):
- Feature teams (end-to-end feature delivery)
- Component teams (architectural layers)
- Platform teams (infrastructure and shared services)

## Using Templates

1. Copy relevant templates to your project
2. Customize based on your team's needs
3. Share with team members
4. Train team on new processes
5. Iterate and improve based on feedback

## Integration with AI Coding Factory

These templates integrate with:
- **Ideation Agent**: Creates user stories for Product Backlog
- **Prototype Agent**: Validates stories with stakeholders
- **Pilot Agent**: Ensures Definition of Done compliance
- **Product Agent**: Monitors sprint progress and metrics

All agents use `net-scrum` skill for Scrum best practices.

## Best Practices

### Team Formation

1. Start with small, stable teams
2. Ensure cross-functional skill sets
3. Favor face-to-face collaboration
4. Build long-term team relationships
5. Maintain team stability

### Sprint Execution

1. Protect sprint scope from changes
2. Focus on delivering working software
3. Prioritize quality over quantity
4. Gather feedback continuously
5. Adapt based on learnings

### Process Improvement

1. Conduct regular retrospectives
2. Act on retrospective actions
3. Share learnings across teams
4. Experiment with process improvements
5. Measure impact of changes

## Enterprise Considerations

### Multiple Teams

- Coordinate dependencies between teams
- Align on common Definition of Done
- Share metrics and best practices
- Conduct joint retrospectives
- Use Scrum of Scrums for coordination

### Scaling

- Start with single team and scale up
- Use appropriate scaling framework (LeSS, SAFe, Nexus)
- Maintain team autonomy while coordinating
- Balance autonomy with alignment
- Ensure clear communication channels
