## User Story Best Practices

### INVEST Criteria
- **I**ndependent: Can be delivered independently

- **V**aluable: Provides value to users
- **E**stimable: Team can estimate effort
- **S**mall: Fits within a sprint
- **T**estable: Has clear acceptance criteria

### Story Format
```
As a [type of user],
I want to [perform an action],
So that I can [achieve a goal].

Acceptance Criteria:

```

### Acceptance Criteria Guidelines
- Use Given-When-Then format
- Be specific and testable
- Include edge cases
- Consider error scenarios
- Keep criteria independent

## Prioritization Frameworks

### MoSCoW Method
| Priority | Description | Sprint Allocation |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Must Have** | Critical for delivery | ~60% of capacity |
| **Should Have** | Important, not critical | ~20% of capacity |
| **Could Have** | Nice to have | ~20% of capacity |
| **Won't Have** | Out of scope | 0% |

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
```
Priority Score = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size
```

### Value vs. Effort Matrix
```
        ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
High    │   Maybe     │  Do First!  │
Value   │   (Defer)   │  (Quick Wins)│
        ├─────────────┼─────────────┤
Low     │   Don't Do  │   Maybe     │
Value   │   (Drop)    │   (Filler)  │
        └─────────────┴─────────────┘
          High Effort   Low Effort
```

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Absent Product Owner
**Problem**: Not available to answer questions
**Impact**: Team makes assumptions, rework increases
**Solution**: Block availability windows, designate backups

### ❌ Proxy Product Owner
**Problem**: Cannot make decisions autonomously
**Impact**: Delays, unclear priorities
**Solution**: Empower with decision-making authority

### ❌ Committee Product Owner
**Problem**: Multiple people "own" the product
**Impact**: Conflicting priorities, unclear direction
**Solution**: Single accountable person

### ❌ Order Taker
**Problem**: Just takes stakeholder requests without prioritization
**Impact**: No strategic value delivery
**Solution**: Actively manage and prioritize backlog

### ❌ Perfectionist
**Problem**: Stories never "ready" enough
**Impact**: Analysis paralysis, slow delivery
**Solution**: Embrace iterative refinement
